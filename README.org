* About

The configuration files for all the programs I use. I try to follow the xdg-config standard for storing configuration files, so most will be in the .config folder.

* Window Managers

Im a big fan of dynamic tiling window managers, they are fast, reliable, minimal and highly configurable. I particularly enjoy tinkering with WMs that are written and configured in the same language, as it give me a chance to learn new  and interesting languages.

 Xmonad
 Awesome

* Text editors

There really are only two choices here. Emacs is more of a Lisp programming enviroment for manipulating text (it can do many things), while I prefer nvim for editing test. I am using the nightly build of neovim, and have configured it entirely in lua. There are some
amzaing packages being written for nvim in lua, but I dont think it is at the stage where it is competative with Emacs. Org-mode turns emacs into a development powerhouse.
